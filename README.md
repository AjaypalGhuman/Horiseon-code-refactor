 # Horiseon-code-refactor


 ## Description
 The code for a business strategy website named Horiseon was refactored to meet accessibility standards and optimized for search engine use. This was done by adding semantic HTML elements with logical structure, styling, and positioning. Alt attributes and a descriptive title were also added to webpages code to further meet proper guidelines.
